# Advanced Business Analysis SDLC Workflow

This document describes a structured approach to integrate advanced Business Analysis (BA) practices into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The workflow focuses on comprehensive requirement gathering, evaluating multiple solution options, and ensuring quality assurance at every step.

## 1. Requirement Gathering

1. **Stakeholder Interviews** – Conduct detailed sessions with end users, product owners, and other stakeholders to capture goals, pain points, and expectations.
2. **Clarification Questions** – Iterate on open questions until requirements are clear and unambiguous.
3. **Document Findings** – Summarize the gathered information in a requirements document (similar to a PRD) that outlines user stories, goals, and acceptance criteria.

## 2. Solution Exploration

1. **Generate Multiple Options** – Based on the requirements, outline several solution approaches. These should vary in complexity and functionality (e.g., minimal viable solution, intermediate feature set, or fully featured implementation).
2. **Compare Trade‑offs** – For each option, list benefits, risks, estimated effort, and dependencies.
3. **Present to the User** – Share the options with the user and capture feedback or a decision.

## 3. Selected Solution Design

1. **Break Down Design** – Once the user selects a solution, expand it into detailed design documentation. Include architecture diagrams, data flow descriptions, and detailed feature specifications.
2. **User Review** – Provide the design documents for the user to review. Revise as needed until approval is granted.

## 4. Implementation with Continuous QA

1. **Task Decomposition** – Translate the approved design into a granular task list for development.
2. **QA Integration** – For each task, define corresponding test cases. Ensure that functional requirements, edge cases, and non‑functional aspects are covered.
3. **Full Test Coverage** – Build automated tests wherever possible to achieve complete functional coverage of all features and acceptance criteria.
4. **Iterative Verification** – During implementation, continuously review progress against the design and run tests to validate functionality.

## 5. Final Review and Sign‑off

1. **User Acceptance** – Demonstrate the implemented solution to the user, highlighting that all documented requirements and test cases have been satisfied.
2. **Post‑Implementation QA** – Execute regression tests and confirm that no existing functionality was affected.
3. **Approval** – Obtain final user sign‑off before deploying to production.

This workflow ensures that business requirements are thoroughly analyzed, solution options are clearly communicated, and quality assurance is embedded throughout the SDLC.
